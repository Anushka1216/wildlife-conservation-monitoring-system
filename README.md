# Wildlife Conservation Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview
A wildlife monitoring and tracking system that visualizes animal and incident locations on a map and helps conservation teams manage operations using automation and analytics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Conservation teams need a centralized system to track wildlife activity, monitor safe zones, manage ranger operations, and analyze incidents/sightings using location-based data.

## ✅ Key Features
- Map-based visualization of animals / zones / sightings
- Safe zone monitoring using geo-distance logic (Haversine)
- Automated alerts + workflows for critical events
- Multi-object system design (data modelling)
- Reports and dashboards for analytics

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Frontend: Map dashboard (component-based UI)
- Backend: Service logic (OOP)
- Data Layer: Query-based data retrieval
- Automation: Workflow automation
- Analytics: Reports & dashboard
- Platform Used: Salesforce (LWC, Apex, Flows)

## 🧠 Software Engineering Highlights
- Designed a scalable multi-object data model
- Implemented backend utility logic for geo-distance calculation (Haversine)
- Applied business rules for safe zone validation + alerts
- Built map-based UI dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Created analytics dashboards for decision making
